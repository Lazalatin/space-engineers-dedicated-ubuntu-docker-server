# Contributing
So you decided to do something for this project? Great!

Whether you:
1. Want to open an issue
1. Want to add or change some code via pull request
1. Want to tell me I am doing bad and I should feel bad about it

***You are welcome!***

## Rules
Up until now I have no rules regarding this project. Maybe I will think of some in the future.
Until then feel free to write or code like you want to. But be prepared, as I am crazy enough to try to correct you in any way, that seems suitable to me! :wink:

## No, really, thank you
For reading this rubbish and having a thought about helping me here. You are an awesome human being. Stay like that, you :blush:
